# Welcome to WatyBot on Github!

### WatyBot is meant to work with and without a bypass, that way I can update it easy.
The AutoBot, Info and PacketSender tabs are all bypassless!!!
The Hacks tab ofcourse not :(

### How to use WatyBot:
I've made a wiki for that kind of questions

### Compiling WatyBot:
If you want to compile WatyBot yourself, you need to have the folowing:
* Boost
* Visual Studio (2012)

### Installing Boost
Installing Boost is easy if you're only going to use it for compiling WatyBot
* Download the latest Boost from http://www.boost.org/
* Extract boost to C:\boost
* And you're done!
